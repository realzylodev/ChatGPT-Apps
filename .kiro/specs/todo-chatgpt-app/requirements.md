# Todo ChatGPT App Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete Todo application that integrates with ChatGPT using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Apps SDK. The application will follow the patterns established in the existing pizzaz examples, providing a rich UI widget for task management alongside structured data handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: MCP Server Implementation

**User Story:** As a ChatGPT user, I want to interact with a todo app through natural language commands, so that I can manage my tasks conversationally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ChatGPT calls the todo tools THEN the MCP server SHALL return both structured data and widget metadata
2. WHEN the server receives a tool call THEN it SHALL validate input parameters using proper schemas
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL expose tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos
4. WHEN the server handles requests THEN it SHALL include proper CORS headers for cross-origin access
5. WHEN the server processes tool calls THEN it SHALL return appropriate success/error responses

### Requirement 2: Task Management Tools

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform CRUD operations on tasks through ChatGPT, so that I can manage my todo list efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask to create a task THEN the system SHALL add a new todo with title, description, and due date
2. WHEN I ask to list tasks THEN the system SHALL return all todos with their current status
3. WHEN I ask to complete a task THEN the system SHALL mark the specified todo as completed
4. WHEN I ask to delete a task THEN the system SHALL remove the todo from the list
5. WHEN I ask to update a task THEN the system SHALL modify the specified todo properties

### Requirement 3: Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my todos to persist between sessions, so that I don't lose my task data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN todos are created or modified THEN the system SHALL save changes to a JSON file
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL load existing todos from the JSON file
3. WHEN the JSON file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it with default empty structure
4. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return appropriate messages

### Requirement 4: Rich UI Widget

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see and interact with my todos in a rich UI widget, so that I have a visual interface for task management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the widget loads THEN it SHALL display all todos in an organized list format
2. WHEN I click on a todo THEN it SHALL allow me to edit the task details inline
3. WHEN I check a todo checkbox THEN it SHALL mark the task as completed
4. WHEN I add a new todo THEN it SHALL appear in the list immediately
5. WHEN todos have due dates THEN they SHALL be visually highlighted if overdue

### Requirement 5: Widget Integration

**User Story:** As a ChatGPT user, I want the todo widget to appear when I interact with todo tools, so that I can see my tasks visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a todo tool is called THEN the response SHALL include widget metadata for rendering
2. WHEN the widget renders THEN it SHALL use the structured data from the tool response
3. WHEN the widget state changes THEN it SHALL communicate updates back to ChatGPT
4. WHEN the widget is in fullscreen mode THEN it SHALL provide expanded functionality
5. WHEN the widget displays THEN it SHALL be responsive and accessible

### Requirement 6: Build and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build and deploy the todo app easily, so that I can run it locally or in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the build command THEN it SHALL generate bundled HTML/JS/CSS assets
2. WHEN I start the MCP server THEN it SHALL serve the built widget assets
3. WHEN I configure the server THEN it SHALL support both development and production modes
4. WHEN I deploy the server THEN it SHALL work with ngrok or cloud hosting
5. WHEN the build fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages
